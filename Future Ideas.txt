-Update UBR to def Arm Method
-Improve UI such as choosing folders, having choices for plots and what to run similar to fracture fatigue
-Check over code for mistakes. Review run values etc.
-L1 normalization for all or some fits (fielding fits seem like they could use it)
-Maybe keep working on fielding calcs. They are sus with the range/arm stuff. Are we accounting for intangibles like outfielders  turning doubles into singles? HOW?
-Will need to add BABIP for perfect team.
-Add ballpark scaling factors for Left and Right handed batters.

Fit Issues
-Investigate Movement
-DP Defense
-SB piecewise for high speed ratings
-1b height
-Keep thinking about how to do arm
-Incorporate GB/FB ratings for pitchers (and batters?)? Might be too much work. Should affect double plays for pitchers but FB may reduce BABIP for pitchers?



Secondary
-Could make it so double/triple/single percents aren't hard coded in DefPred.m


Notes
-BABIP has a break at 100 (Points in editor with rating on left and resulting contact on right, all other
ratings left at 100)
POW Points (0,90) and (200,144) 
AvoidK Points (20,73) and (200,144), below 20 avoid K falls off HARD (0,19)
BABIP Points (0,42) and (200,180)
-Ratings add if both going above or both going below 100. Otherwise must get to 100 to use those values
-When AVOID K RATING = 20 POW Points,
